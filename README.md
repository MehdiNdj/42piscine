# 42 piscine

These are all the exercises/projects I've made during my "Piscine" at 42 Paris.

## Overall week organization

Monday to Thursday were dedicated to the "Days", which are different exercises we needed to do, all by ourselves, by searching on internet and/or by asking help to other students.

Fridays were the Exam days, the 3 first ones lasted 4 hours, and the final one 8 hours.

The weekends were dedicated to group projects called "Rushs".

## Days

These are all the exercises we needed to do during the week from Monday to Thursday, these were all sent to be evaluated by other students and an automatic program called "Moulinette", which was very precise and didn't allow any extra tab or space in our codes.

We started with Shell then pursued with C exercises, recreating different C functions and playing around with the different possibilities of this language.

## Exams
During exams, we didn't have any accessible resources, no internet, and we had exercises to send to an automatic program. Each time we sent a code that was incorrect, we needed to wait an extra (exponential) time before sending another, and we had to complete one exercise before we could access the next.

## Rushs

These were the group projects we needed to make during our piscine. Random students were assigned together, we had the weekend to finish and submit the project, and then we had to defend it in front of a jury during the week after.

## Mains
Since we didn't have to send the mains to be evaluated by the automatic program and other students, the last file contains all the different mains I've made to test my codes.

## Final thoughts
It was a really exciting, rewarding and empowering experience. It was very intensive and stressful, but overall it was a wonderful experience, filled with lots of learning and great encounters.
